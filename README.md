#An answer to a book which Samuel Eaton put up to the Parliament: which he saith he is a teacher of the Church of Christ, heretofore meeting at Ducken-field, now at Stockport in Cheshire; and he cals the title of his book Quakers confuted. Moses who was a judg quaked and trembled, David a king in Israel quaked and trembled, and Solomon who was a king trembled, and Daniel a servant of the most high God trembled, ... And these heard the voice of God, and thou that writest, thou mayest say thou hast confuted all them; for he that is against them, is against us, and he that is against us, is against them, for the same power is witnessed; but thou Eaton, who saith thou art a teacher of the church at Duckenfield, who saith thou hast heard the voice of the living God, and that such a voice as this, as comes immediately from God, you have not heard, ... And Isaiah saith, hear the word of the Lord all ye that tremble at his word; and this is the man that I do regard, saith the Lord, that is of a contrite heart, and trembleth at my word; but such Eaton and his church doth not regard, but custs out friends of the Lord from them, whom the world calls Quakers.#
